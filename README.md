# ChoreBot

ChoreBot is a project designed to aid families and groups of individuals in managing and keeping track of chores via the medium of Discord. As a versatile chat platform, Discord provides an ideal basis for ChoreBot, a tool that extends its capabilities to manage real-world tasks.

The aim of ChoreBot is to transform chore management from a manually supervised process into an automated, streamlined system. By using a Discord bot for this purpose, we can integrate chore management seamlessly into a platform already used by many families and friend groups for communication.

ChoreBot works by periodically sending prompts for each chore based on a predefined schedule. These prompts can be 'claimed' by users, who then take responsibility for the given chore. The bot ensures that chores don't get overlooked by sending reminders if no one claims a chore. Additionally, one-off chores can be added through a slash command, increasing flexibility.

Why ChoreBot? The traditional chore management system often involves manual tracking and reminding, which can be inefficient and fallible. ChoreBot aims to solve this issue by automating the process, making it more reliable and efficient. By leveraging Discord, ChoreBot also encourages engagement and interaction, potentially making chores feel less like work and more like part of the routine of daily life.

Ultimately, ChoreBot is about using technology to simplify life. In today's busy world, anything that can save time and reduce stress is worth exploring. We hope that ChoreBot will prove to be a helpful tool for many families and groups of individuals.
